	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>4 Tablespoon oil</li>
		<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 inch fresh ginger, grated</li>
		<li>1 habanero pepper, chopped</li>
		<li>1 Tablespoon tomato paste</li>
		<li>1 and 1/2 cans of tomato, chopped</li>
		<li>1 seasoning cube/bouillon cube (or salt to taste)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
		<li>2 cups long grain rice (Thai jasmine)</li>
		<li>2 cups hot water or stock/broth</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3>Instructions:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Rinse your ice and start some water boiling</li>
		<li>To make the stew base, heat the oil in a heavy bottomed saucepan.</li>
		<li>Put the onions in the saucepan and fry the onions until golden brown.</li>
		<li>Add the garlic and ginger. Then add the tomato paste.</li>
		<li>Add the thyme and bouillon cube, followed by the chopped tomato and habanero pepper.</li>
		<li>Cook the sauce for about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir continuously to make sure it is not burning at the bottom.</li>
		<li>While the tomato sauce is cooking, soak the rinsed rice in some boiled water until the stew base is ready.</li>
		<li>Once the stew is thick, with an oily film forming on the surface. Strain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Season to taste carefully.</li>
		<li>Top up the pot with enough water or broth. This would normally be about 2 cups. You may need to add more later if the rice is still hard.</li>
		<li>Stir to mix, then bring to a boil, then reduce to medium heat.</li>
		<li>Once simmering nicely and the moisture has nearly all gone, add aluminum foil to cover it. Close with an airtight lid. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>Taste the rice. Once the grains are cooked it is ready.</li>
	</ol>

 		<div class="home">
 			<p>Hello. My name is Papa Amoateng and this is my three favorite things website. I had to think about this a lot because I am not the one to categorize things as my favorite. The only thing that I have had as a favorite is the color orange. Everything esle I have no opinion or at least I like to keep my options opened about. </p>
 			<p>So I have decided to group my favorite things in three categories as you can see which are: shows, cars, and social media. I felt that these were the important of my favorite things.

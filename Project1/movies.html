 			<p>My favorite show is the anime know as One Piece. It is an incredible show. Being an anime watcher I felt that it was kind of an obligation for me to watch One Piece. I had heard rumors that it was going to end soon so I decided that it would be a something worth watching and something I could watch uninterrupted. </p>

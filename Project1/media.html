 			<p>As may have been hinted on the cars page. My favorite Social Media is youtube. It is ubiquitous. It is all things video. It has the news, youtubers, movies, but what it really is is a video storage platform when you think about. I watch things ranging from anime reviews, car reviews, vlogs, podcasts, and even piano lessons. I think that it is the greatest invention since slice bread.</p>

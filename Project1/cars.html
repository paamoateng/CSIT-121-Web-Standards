 			<p>I love watching car reviews on Youtube. I think that my love of McLarens come from the fact that I wanted to be a contrarian. Most people love Lamborghinis and I do too those sharp edges makes it look nice but the smoothness of a McLaren trumps it in my opnion. My favorite car youtuber is "TheStradMan". Another reason that I like the 720s is that it was the first McLaren I ever saw and I like the butterfly doors even though it is not really practical.</p>
